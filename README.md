# 🧮 Coding Solutions/Representations for Various Mathematical Problems

Welcome to the Mathematical Problem Solving repository! This project provides algorithmic solutions or visualitzations to a variety of mathematical problems. Whether you're a student, developer, or mathematics enthusiast, this repository serves as a practical reference to explore how to tackle complex mathematical tasks.

## About

In this repository, you'll find implementations of the following popular mathematical problems:

### ♟️ The Trapped Knight

The Trapped Knight is a mathematical problem centred arround chess. 
For an explanation of the problem, here is a complete article about it: https://scipython.com/blog/the-trapped-knight/

#### Structure

 - Trapped Knight: Defines a board of n by n (n determined by user) and makes L (2x1) shaped moves until the knight cannot move.
 - Trapped Long Knight: Defines a board of n by n (n determined by user) and makes long L (3x1) shaped moves until the knight cannot move.

### The 3n + 1 Problem (Collatz Conjecture) 🔄🔢

This repository implements a solution to the famous **3n + 1 Problem**, also known as the **Collatz Conjecture**. The conjecture states that, starting with any positive integer `n`, the following process will eventually reach the number 1:
- If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
- If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

This cycle is repeated until the number reaches 1.

### Mersenne Prime Finder 🔢🚀

A simple and efficient tool to find **Mersenne Prime Numbers** within a given range of exponents `x` to `y`. A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form `M_n = 2^n - 1`, where `n` is an integer. This project helps you find all Mersenne primes within any user-defined range by testing exponents between `x` and `y`.
